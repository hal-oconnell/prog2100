//a namespace is a collection of class definitions
//and variable declarations (aka name definitions).
//The std namespace contains all the names defined
//in many standard C++ library files such as
//<iostream>. #include <iostream> places all the name
//definitions for names such as cin and cout into
//the std namespace. You must use the 'using namespace'
//directive to establish the link between your program
// and the definitions you have placed in it.
