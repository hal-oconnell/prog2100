//A type alias is a different name by which a type can be identified.
//C++ supports two ways of doing this - typedef and using.
//The purpose of typedef is to form complex types from more-basic machine types
//and assign simpler names to such combinations. They are most often used when 
//a standard declaration is cumbersome, potentially confusing, or likely to 
//vary from one implementation to another.
